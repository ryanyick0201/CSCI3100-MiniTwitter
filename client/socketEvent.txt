Socket event
--------------------
Notes:  All FE socket events are in the useXXX.jsx files,
        Expect BE to maintain an array of online users and their corresponding socket Id
        const NEW_MESSAGE_EVENT = "newMessageEvent"

Event sequence:
// When a user (sender) open the chatroom with another user (recipient)
Client -> Server: emit("joinRoom", [msgSender, msgRecipient])
/* then Server should emit another event to pass the chat history between the two to client */

// When sender sends message
Client -> Server: emit(NEW_MESSAGE_EVENT, {
      sender: msgSender,
      recipient: msgRecipient,
      isImg: isImg,
      message: messageBody, // if (isImg): message = {file, mimeType, fileName} else message is String
      sendTime: new Date()
    });
/* Server sets maxHttpBufferSize to accommodate larger files (default: 1MB) */
/* then Server should emit(NEW_MESSAGE_EVENT, msgObj) to the room, where msgObj := the message object sent to the server
   write the msgObj to DB,
   emit("getNotification", panelList) to the each user in the room, each user should have its unique list
      where panelList := the list on the LHS panel of Whatsapp/ Signal
